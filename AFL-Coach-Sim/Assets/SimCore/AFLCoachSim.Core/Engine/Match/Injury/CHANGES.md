# Legacy Injury System Removal - Changes Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to completely remove the legacy injury system and standardize on the modern injury system.

## Files Removed

1. **`InjuryModel.cs` (legacy version)** - The old simple severity-based injury model
2. **`InjuryModelAdapter.cs`** - The adapter that provided backward compatibility

## Files Modified

### Core System Files

1. **`InjuryModel.cs` (new version)**
   - Renamed from `EnhancedInjuryModel.cs`
   - Now the single injury model for the system
   - Provides comprehensive injury simulation with unified system integration

2. **`MatchEngine.cs`**
   - **BREAKING CHANGE**: `InjuryManager` parameter is now **required**
   - Removed legacy fallback paths and adapter logic  
   - Simplified initialization and injury processing
   - Added comprehensive injury reporting
   - Updated method signature: `PlayMatch(..., InjuryManager injuryManager, ...)`

3. **`MatchContext.cs`**
   - Removed legacy `InjuryModel` reference
   - Added `MatchInjuryContextProvider` for contextual injury information
   - Simplified to single injury system

4. **`MatchTuning.cs`**
   - Enhanced with detailed injury type probabilities
   - Added age-based risk modifiers
   - Added performance impact scaling parameters
   - Added recovery time modifiers

### Test Files

1. **`InjuryModelTests.cs`** (renamed from `EnhancedInjuryModelTests.cs`)
   - Updated to test the new simplified system
   - Removed adapter-related test complexity

### Example Files  

1. **`MatchInjuryExample.cs`** (renamed from `EnhancedMatchInjuryExample.cs`)
   - Updated to demonstrate simplified system usage
   - Removed legacy example methods
   - Shows proper `InjuryManager` initialization

## Breaking Changes

### MatchEngine.PlayMatch() Method
**Before:**
```csharp
// Legacy - InjuryManager was optional
var result = MatchEngine.PlayMatch(
    round: 1,
    homeId: TeamId.Adelaide, 
    awayId: TeamId.Brisbane,
    teams: teams,
    rosters: rosters
    // injuryManager was optional parameter
);
```

**After:**
```csharp
// Modern - InjuryManager is required
var result = MatchEngine.PlayMatch(
    round: 1,
    homeId: TeamId.Adelaide,
    awayId: TeamId.Brisbane, 
    teams: teams,
    injuryManager: injuryManager, // REQUIRED parameter
    rosters: rosters
);
```

### MatchContext Changes
**Before:**
```csharp
// Had both legacy and enhanced systems
ctx.InjuryModel          // Legacy
ctx.InjuryModelAdapter   // Adapter
```

**After:**
```csharp
// Single modern system
ctx.InjuryModel              // Modern injury model
ctx.InjuryContextProvider    // Context provider
```

## Migration Guide

To update existing code:

1. **Update MatchEngine calls:**
   - Add `InjuryManager` parameter (required)
   - Ensure you have injury management system set up

2. **Update MatchContext usage:**
   - Use `ctx.InjuryModel` (no longer needs adapter)
   - Access `ctx.InjuryContextProvider` for match context

3. **Update tests:**
   - Create `InjuryManager` instance for testing
   - Pass to `MatchEngine.PlayMatch()` calls

## Benefits of Changes

1. **Simplified Codebase**
   - Removed adapter pattern complexity
   - Single injury system to maintain
   - Clearer code paths and logic

2. **Better Performance**
   - No adapter overhead
   - Direct calls to injury system
   - Optimized initialization

3. **Enhanced Features**
   - Rich contextual injury descriptions
   - Comprehensive analytics and reporting
   - Realistic AFL-style injury simulation
   - Weather and environmental effects

4. **Better Integration**
   - Seamless training system integration
   - Unified injury management across all systems
   - Consistent injury tracking and reporting

## Compatibility Notes

- **Unity Version**: Maintains compatibility with Unity 6000.2.1f1
- **API Surface**: Core injury simulation API remains stable
- **Performance**: Similar or better performance characteristics
- **Data Format**: Uses unified injury system data structures

## Testing

All existing tests have been updated to use the simplified system:
- Unit tests for `InjuryModel`
- Integration tests for `MatchEngine` 
- Example usage in `MatchInjuryExample`

The system maintains the same level of test coverage while being significantly simpler to understand and maintain.
